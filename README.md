> ### Tip!
> Learn new stack from simple but real use cases

## Uses
  - vuex
  - vue-router

## What's for

Creates freeCampCode challenge markdown definitions, which internally
are created as json files, so you can contribute to freeCampCode
knowledge curriculum

## How it works?

- Edit *in-place* markdown definitions, html sources & tests, plus you can also run the tests & see their results
- You can quickly add/edit/clone or remove challenges
- You can quickly add/edit/clone or remove challenge tests
- Save your downloaded definitions into the freeCampCode challenges folder and rebuild freeCampCode project to see the new definitions

## Disclaimer
This implementation may not cover all freeCampCode challenge features but only the basic ones

To avoid manually copying challenge definitions, some sort of api integration should be implemented to retrieve existing ones and append new ones

This is just the starting point...
